### Autocards usage

```
# loading
from autocards import Autocards
a = Autocards(in_lang="any", out_lang="ru")  # translation modules sometimes need to be downloaded and can be rather large

# eating the input text using one of the following ways:
a.consume_var(my_text, per_paragraph=True)
a.consume_user_input(title="")
a.consume_textfile(filename, per_paragraph=True)
a.consume_pdf(pdf_path, per_paragraph=True)
a.consume_web(source, mode="url", element="p")
# =>  * element is the html element, like p for paragraph
#     * mode can be "url" or "local"

# three ways to get the results back: printing, pandas, export
out = a.string_output(prefix='', jeopardy=False)
#    =>  * prefix is a text that will be appended before the qa
#        * jeopardy is when switching question and answer
a.print(prefix='', jeopardy=False)
a.pprint(prefix='', jeopardy=False)  # pretty printing
df = a.pandas_df(prefix='')
a.to_csv("output.csv", prefix="")
a.to_json("output.json", prefix="")

# Also note that a user provided his own terrible scripts that you can get inspiration from, they are located in the folder `examples_script`
```
